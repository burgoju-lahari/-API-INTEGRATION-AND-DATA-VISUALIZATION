Task: API Integration and Data Visualization
As part of my internship, I worked on a task involving API integration and data visualization using Python. The objective was to fetch real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API and create a simple visual representation of the data.

Tools and Platform Used:
Python – The programming language used for fetching and processing data.
Requests – To send API requests and retrieve weather data.
Matplotlib – Used for creating visualizations.
VS Code (Visual Studio Code) – The platform where I wrote and executed the code.
GitHub – Used to store and share my project files.

Task Overview:
The task required fetching live weather data for a specific city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The data included important details like temperature, humidity, pressure, and weather description. After retrieving the data, I visualized it using a bar chart in Matplotlib to make it easier to understand. The goal was to present the information in a simple and readable format.

I started by making an API request to OpenWeatherMap using the requests library. The API responded with JSON data, which contained multiple weather parameters. I then extracted key details, including temperature (°C), humidity (%), and pressure (hPa). These values were displayed as output and then represented visually using a bar chart in Matplotlib

Where This Task Can Be Applied:
Weather Forecasting Apps – Can be used to develop simple weather monitoring applications.
Climate Research – Helps in analyzing historical weather data for research.
IoT Applications – Smart devices can use weather APIs for automation, like adjusting home temperature or smart irrigation systems.
Travel & Logistics – Weather data helps airlines and logistics companies plan better routes.
Data Visualization Dashboards – This method can be expanded into a complete dashboard displaying real-time weather trends.
This task was a great introduction to working with APIs and visualizing data in a beginner-friendly way. It provided hands-on experience with Python, API handling, and basic data visualization, which are useful skills in data analysis and software development.
